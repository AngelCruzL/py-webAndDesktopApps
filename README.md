# Web Apps and Desktop GUI Apps

This repository contains the source code for the following web apps and desktop GUI apps:

- [Flask Basic Server](01-flask-web-app.py)
- [PyQt6 Desktop GUI App - Sentence Maker](02-sentence_maker.py)
- [Desktop GUI App - Currency Converter](03-currency_converter.py)
- [Desktop GUI App - Currency Converter with advanced layouts](04-currency_converter_v2.py)

It's important to notice than the web apps are not meant to be used in production, but rather as a way to learn how to build them.

To use it I recommend you to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
